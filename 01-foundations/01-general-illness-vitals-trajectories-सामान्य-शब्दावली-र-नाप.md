## 3. Changes, Trajectories & Symptoms

- To increase / go up (used for symptoms, labs, weight): *Badhne* (बढ्ने) or *Badhyo* (बढ्यो). Example: *Toul badheko chha* (Weight has increased) or *Dukhani badhyo* (Pain increased).

- To decrease / go down: *Ghatne* (घट्ने) or *Ghatyo* (घट्यो). Example: *Toul ghateko chha* (Weight has decreased).

- Weight loss (Symptom): *Toul ghatne* (तौल घट्ने) or *Jiou sukdai gayeko* (body drying up/wasting away).

- Improving / Getting better: *Sudhaar aayeko* (सुधार आएको) or *Bishak bhayeko* (बिसक भएको).

- Worsening / Flaring up (relapse): *Baljhiyo* (बल्झियो - flared up) or *Ajha kharaab bhayo* (अझ खराब भयो - got worse).

- Spreading (e.g., pain, rash, infection): *Faileyko* (फैलिएको), *Sarne* (सर्ने), or *Saryo* (सर्यो - it spread).

- Coming and going (e.g., pain, fever): *Aaune jane garne* (आउने जाने गर्ने).

- Swelling decreased / went down: *Basyo* (बस्यो - lit. "sat" or settled down) or *Sukyo* (सुक्यो - shrunk/dried up). Example: *Sunnieko basyo* (the swelling went down).

## 4. Symptom Pattern: *Lagnu* (लाग्नु)

- *Lagnu* (लाग्नु) is one of the most important verbs in symptom language. In these contexts it often means "to feel," "to experience," or "to come on," not literally "to attach."

- Common forms: *Lagchha* (लाग्छ - feels / seems), *Lagyo* (लाग्यो - felt / came on), and *Laageko chha* (लागेको छ - is being felt / has been present).

- This pattern is especially common for internal states such as hunger, sleepiness, chills, fear, nausea, discomfort, and difficulty. English speakers often expect a verb like "to be" here, but Nepali often uses *Lagnu* (लाग्नु) instead.

- Hunger / feeling hungry: *Bhok lagyo* (भोक लाग्यो). Back-translation: "Hunger came / was felt."

- Sleepiness / feeling sleepy: *Nidra lagyo* (निद्रा लाग्यो) or *Nindra lagyo* (निन्द्रा लाग्यो).

- Feeling cold / having chills: *Jaado lagyo* (जाडो लाग्यो).

- Nausea / queasiness: *Ghin lagyo* (घिन लाग्यो) or *Wakwaki lagyo* (वाकवाकी लाग्यो).

- Fear / feeling afraid: *Darr lagyo* (डर लाग्यो).

- Breathing feels difficult: *Saas ferna garo lagyo* (सास फेर्न गाह्रो लाग्यो).

- This is different from pain verbs like *Dukhnu* (दुख्नु), which are often used more directly for pain itself: *Pet dukhyo* (पेट दुख्यो - the stomach hurt) versus *Ghin lagyo* (घिन लाग्यो - nausea was felt).

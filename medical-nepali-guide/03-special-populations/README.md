## Organization Notes

- Women's health and pediatrics are grouped separately from organ systems because each chapter mixes anatomy, symptoms, life-stage language, and culture-specific phrasing.
- The original content is preserved in place; this grouping simply keeps special-population terminology easier to locate.

## 3. Writing Prescriptions & Instructions for Nepali Pharmacies

- When writing a prescription for a local Nepali pharmacy, you will often see South Asian / Commonwealth-style abbreviations such as *OD, BD, TDS, QDS, HS,* and *SOS*. Many trained pharmacists understand them. However, abbreviation practice is not perfectly uniform, and some institutions prefer writing frequencies in full for safety. When the patient or family will read the instruction directly, plain-language instructions are usually better.

- A useful practical rule for North American prescribers: if the timing or interval truly matters, write the exact interval or time rather than relying only on frequency shorthand.

### North American to Nepali/South Asian Abbreviation Guide

| North American shorthand | Common shorthand in Nepal / South Asia | Meaning | Practical note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `daily` / `qd` | `OD` / `1x1` | once daily | Often understood as once per day. If timing matters, write the time explicitly. |
| `BID` | `BD` / `BDS` / `1x2` | twice daily | Often practically understood as morning and evening, not necessarily exactly 12 hours apart. |
| `TID` | `TDS` / `1x3` | three times daily | Often read as morning, midday, and evening, not always true q8h dosing. |
| `QID` | `QDS` / `1x4` | four times daily | Commonly understood by pharmacists. |
| `PRN` | `SOS` or `PRN` | as needed | `SOS` is a medical Latin abbreviation from *si opus sit* ("if there is need" / "if necessary"), not the ship-distress signal. It is best to specify the symptom, minimum interval, and maximum daily dose. |
| `STAT` | `STAT` | give now / immediately | In many Nepali and broader South Asian prescribing contexts, this often functions more like "give now" or "first dose now" than a narrowly emergency-only order. If you mean true emergency urgency, say that explicitly in words. |
| `qHS` / `HS` | `HS` / `Nocte` | at bedtime / every night | Useful for nighttime medicines. |
| `qAM` | `Mane` / `OM` | every morning | More Commonwealth than North American in flavor, but commonly recognized. |
| `AC` | `AC` | before meals | For patient instructions, plain language is often clearer. |
| `PC` | `PC` | after food / after meals | Very common on South Asian prescriptions. |
| `PO` | `PO` | by mouth / orally | Usually understood without difficulty. |
| `q4h`, `q6h`, `q8h`, etc. | often written the same way, or in words | every 4 / 6 / 8 hours | Better than `BD/TDS` when interval-sensitive dosing matters. |

- `OD` deserves extra caution: in medicine here it is often used for *once daily*, but in ophthalmology `OD` can also mean *right eye*. If there is any chance of confusion, write `once daily` or write the dose timing in full.

- `SOS` / `PRN` safety note: do not leave it as just `SOS` if misuse would matter. It is better to write what it is for, how often it can repeat, and the maximum in 24 hours.

- `STAT` safety note: if you mean "first dose immediately," `STAT` is usually understood. If you mean "treat this as an emergency," write that out separately rather than assuming the word `STAT` will carry the whole urgency.

- Hand-drawn strip/box shorthand note: in Nepal, patients often bring blister strips, boxes, or bottles with pharmacy-written timing marks that follow broader South Asian conventions. Published Nepal-specific guidance on these exact hand-drawn patterns is sparse, but the conventions below match widely used regional prescribing shorthand. The safest reading is usually **morning - midday - evening/night** unless `HS` is written separately for bedtime.

### Common Pharmacy Timing Diagrams on Strips, Boxes, and Bottles

These are not fully standardized. Pharmacists may write numbers, circles, or `x` marks on the packaging. If there is any ambiguity, confirm with the patient, family, or dispensing pharmacy rather than guessing.

| Pattern seen on the packet | Usual meaning | Nepali explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1-0-1` | one in the morning, none at midday, one at night | *Bihana ek, diuso chaina, raati ek* (बिहान एक, दिउँसो छैन, राति एक) or more naturally *Bihana ra raati khane* (बिहान र राति खाने) |
| `0-1-0` | one at midday only | *Diuso ek matra* (दिउँसो एक मात्र) |
| `0-0-1` | one at night only | *Raati ek matra* (राति एक मात्र) |
| `1 HS` | one at bedtime | *Sutnu aghi ek* (सुत्नु अघि एक) |
| `1/2-1/2-1` | half in the morning, half at midday, one at night | *Bihana aadha, diuso aadha, raati ek* (बिहान आधा, दिउँसो आधा, राति एक) |

- Important correction: `0-0-0` would normally mean **no dose in any of the three slots**, so it is **not** the right way to indicate three times daily. If someone means a regular three-times-daily pattern, the clearer numeric shorthand is usually `1-1-1` by extension of the same morning-midday-night logic.

- Older or less standardized variants may use `x` and `o` instead of numbers. In a widely used South Asian patient-medicine handbook, examples include:
  - `x-o-x` for morning and night
  - `o-x-o` or `0-1-0` for midday only
  - `o-o-x` or `x-x-1` for night only

- Be careful with `x`: some writers use it to mean **take one**, while others use it to mean **no dose**. Because of that, `1-0-1` style numeric notation is safer and clearer than `x-o-x`.

- The third slot is often used loosely for *beluka / raati* (बेलुका / राति - evening / night). If a true bedtime dose is intended, pharmacies may write `HS` separately instead of relying on the third slot alone.

- In practice, you may also see the same pattern extended in an intuitive way, such as `1-0-0` (morning only), `1-1-0` (morning and midday), `0-1-1` (midday and night), or `1-1-1` (morning, midday, and night). These are straightforward extensions of the same convention, but they are less explicitly documented than the examples above.

### Other Common Pharmacist Handwriting on Packets, Bottles, and Boxes

Patients also commonly bring medicines with short handwritten instructions that are not full prescriptions but quick reminders added by the pharmacist or family. These are again only partly standardized, so when the stakes are high, confirm rather than assuming.

| Marking or shorthand seen | Usual meaning | Nepali explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BF` / `AC` | before food / before meals | *Khana khanu aghi* (खाना खानु अघि) |
| `AF` / `PC` | after food / after meals | *Khana khaepachi* (खाना खाएपछि) |
| `BBF` | before breakfast | *Bihana ko khana aghi* (बिहानको खाना अघि) |
| `ABF` | after breakfast | *Bihana ko khana khaepachi* (बिहानको खाना खाएपछि) |
| `BL` / `AL` | before lunch / after lunch | *Diuso ko khana aghi / pachhi* (दिउँसोको खाना अघि / पछि) |
| `BDN` / `ADN` | before dinner / after dinner | *Beluka / raati ko khana aghi / pachhi* (बेलुका / रातिको खाना अघि / पछि) |
| `HS` / `BT` | bedtime | *Sutnu aghi* (सुत्नु अघि) |
| `1/2`, `½`, or a split dose written beside a tablet | half tablet | *Aadha goli* (आधा गोली) |
| `5 mL`, `1 tsp`, `1/2 tsp` | liquid dose | *5 mL*, *ek chamcha* (एक चम्चा), or *aadha chamcha* (आधा चम्चा) depending on how it was explained |
| `x 5 days`, `5 d`, `5 din` | continue for five days | *Paanch din samma* (पाँच दिनसम्म) |

- On bottles and strips, you may also see locally improvised pictograms such as a **sun** for morning and a **moon** for night. These drawings are easy to understand but are not standardized enough to interpret blindly without context.

- A very common mixed pattern is something like `1-0-1 AF` or `1-1-1 PC`. Read these as a timing pattern plus a food instruction, for example:
  - `1-0-1 AF` = morning and night, after food
  - `1-1-1 PC` = three times daily, after meals

- `BF/AF` and `AC/PC` are usually the most important “extra” handwriting marks because they affect whether the patient takes the dose on an empty stomach or after eating.

- `BBF`, `ABF`, `BL`, `AL`, `BDN`, and `ADN` are seen more in some hospital, diabetes, or follow-up contexts than in every retail packet, but they do show up often enough that they are worth recognizing.

- When writing instructions directly for the patient (or translating what the pharmacist will tell them), use this format (*Note: Patak and Palta are interchangeable words for "times"*):

- **1x1 (OD):** "Din ko ek patak" or "Din ko ek palta" (दिनको एक पटक / पल्ट)

- **1x2 (BD):** "Bihana ra beluka" (बिहान र बेलुका - morning and evening)

- **1x3 (TDS):** "Bihana, diuso, ra beluka" (बिहान, दिउँसो, र बेलुका)

- **1x4 (QDS):** "Bihana, diuso, beluka, ra sutnu aghi" (बिहान, दिउँसो, बेलुका, र सुत्नु अघि) or simply "Din ko char patak/palta" (दिनको चार पटक / पल्ट)

- **SOS (As needed for pain):** "Dukheko bela ma matra khane" (दुखेको बेलामा मात्र खाने)

- **STAT (Take immediately):** "Ahile nai khane" (अहिले नै खाने)

- **HS / At bedtime:** "Sutnu aghi khane" (सुत्नु अघि खाने)

- **AC / Before meals:** "Khana khanu aghi khane" (खाना खानु अघि खाने)

- **PC / After meals:** "Khana khaepachi khane" (खाना खाएपछि खाने)

- **Every 6 hours:** "Harek 6 ghanta ma khane" (हरेक ६ घण्टामा खाने)

- **Complete the full course (antibiotics):** "Aushadhi ko course pura garne, bichai ma nachhodne" (औषधिको कोर्स पूरा गर्ने, बीचैमा नछोड्ने - finish the course, don't stop in the middle).

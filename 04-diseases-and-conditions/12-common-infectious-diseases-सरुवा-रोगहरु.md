# Section 12: Common Infectious Diseases (सरुवा रोगहरु)

## 1. Respiratory & Systemic Infections

- <details>
  <summary>Common Cold: <em>Rugha</em> (रुघा).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Often treated at home with hot water, ginger, and honey. It is very common for patients to attribute a cold to <em>chiso lagera</em> (getting chilled/exposed to cold air or water) rather than a virus.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Cough & Cold: <em>Rugha khoki</em> (रुघा खोकी).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> When presenting at a clinic for <em>rugha khoki</em>, patients frequently expect to be prescribed antibiotics right away. You may need to spend time explaining viral vs. bacterial etiology.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Fever: <em>Jwaro</em> (ज्वरो) or <em>Jwaro aayeko</em> (having a fever).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> A vital follow-up question is asking about the fever pattern. You can ask, <em>"Jaddo lagera aauchha?"</em> (Does it come with chills/rigors?)
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Flu / Viral Fever: <em>Viral jwaro</em> (भाइरल ज्वरो).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> This is a massive catch-all term in Nepal. Many patients will self-diagnose any non-specific malaise, body ache, and low-grade fever as "Viral jwaro."
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Pneumonia: <em>Pneumonia</em> (निमोनिया).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> This is a source of anxiety for parents of young children. If a child has rapid breathing, older relatives might also refer to the chest indrawing as <em>dhyap-dhyape</em>.
  </details>

- Covid-19: *Covid* (कोभिड) or *Corona* (कोरोना).

- <details>
  <summary>Tuberculosis (TB): <em>Kshayarog</em> (क्षयरोग - formal) or simply <em>TB</em> (टी.बी. - universal).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> TB carries a historical stigma, but public health messaging has improved this. The DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course) program is heavily utilized here, and patients generally know that government health posts provide TB medication for free.
  </details>

## 2. Gastrointestinal Infections

- <details>
  <summary>Diarrhea / Gastroenteritis: <em>Jhada pakhala</em> (झाडा पखाला) or simply <em>Pakhala</em> (पखाला).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Extremely common, especially during the monsoon season due to water contamination. The standard public health treatment pushed by FCHVs is <em>Jeevan Jal</em> (जीवन जल, literally "Water of Life"), the universally recognized local brand name for Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS).
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Dysentery (blood/mucus in stool): <em>Aau</em> (आउँ) or <em>Aau pareko</em> (आउँ परेको) for mucus, <em>Disa ma ragat</em> (दिसामा रगत) for blood, or <em>Ragate aau</em> (रगते आउँ) for bloody dysentery.</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> This is an important clinical distinction from watery diarrhea. Patients may specifically tell you <em>"Aau parya chha"</em> to indicate mucus in the stool, or <em>"Disa ma ragat aayo"</em> to report blood in the stool. Both strongly point toward amebic or bacillary dysentery. 
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Cholera: <em>Haija</em> (हैजा).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> While endemic, it usually presents as localized outbreak clusters during the rainy season. 
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Typhoid: <em>Typhoid</em> (टाइफाइड - universal loanword).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> <strong>Highly relevant clinical note:</strong> Typhoid is massively overdiagnosed by local pharmacies ("Medicals"). They frequently run a rapid Widal test, misinterpret a false positive, and prescribe heavy antibiotics. Expect many patients to come in stating they "have typhoid" when they actually just have a simple viral illness.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Jaundice / Hepatitis: <em>Kamalpitta</em> (कमलपित्त) or <em>Jaundice</em> (जन्डिस).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> There are intense cultural beliefs surrounding jaundice. Patients diagnosed with it will often put themselves on an incredibly strict, bland diet—completely eliminating oil (<em>tel</em>), spices, and especially turmeric (<em>besar</em>)—believing that yellow foods worsen the yellow disease.
  </details>

## 3. Vector-Borne & Zoonotic Diseases

- <details>
  <summary>Dengue: <em>Dengue</em> (डेंगु - universal loanword).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Some ares of Nepal have seen major Dengue outbreaks in recent post-monsoon seasons. Patients will easily recognize the English loanword, but it is also sometimes descriptively called <em>Haddi futne jwaro</em> (breakbone fever).
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Scrub Typhus: <em>Scrub Typhus</em> (स्क्रब टाइफस - universal loanword).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Very prevalent in this region, especially among people who cut grass or work in the bushes where chiggers live. It presents very similarly to Dengue, making it a key differential diagnosis for acute undifferentiated fevers.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Malaria: <em>Malaria</em> (मलेरिया - widely used loanword) or <em>Aulo</em> (औलो - traditional).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Historically more common in the southern Terai plains, but mosquito vectors are moving up into the hills. It is less common in hilly areas, but still a consideration, especially if the patient has traveled south.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Rabies: <em>Rebij</em> (रेबिज), <em>Jalatraas</em> (जलत्रास - formal hydrophobia), or <em>Baula kukur le tokeko rog</em>.</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Street dogs and rhesus macaques are the primary vectors. Most patients are focused on post-exposure prophylaxis, which is universally referred to as <em>"Rebij ko sui"</em> (rabies injection).
  </details>

## 4. Skin & Other Infections

- <details>
  <summary>Measles: <em>Dadura</em> (दादुरा).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Traditionally associated with the displeasure of local deities (like the goddess Harati Ajima). In some rural or highly traditional families, they may delay bringing the child to a clinic in favor of performing home pujas (prayers) first.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Chickenpox: <em>Theula</em> (ठेउला).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Similar cultural context to measles regarding traditional beliefs.
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Tetanus: <em>Dhanushtankar</em> (धनुष्टंकार).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> You will rarely hear the word <em>Dhanushtankar</em> from a patient. Instead, if a patient gets a cut from metal or glass, they will almost always come in asking for <em>"T.T. ko sui"</em> or just <em>"Tetanus ko sui"</em>(Tetanus Toxoid injection).
  </details>

- <details>
  <summary>Leprosy: <em>Kushtarog</em> (कुष्ठरोग).</summary>
  <br>
  <strong>Context:</strong> Cases still exist in Nepal, though the government has worked hard on eradication and treatment. It remains highly stigmatized. The primary dedicated treatment centers are Anandaban Hospital, located near Kathmandu, Lalgadh Leprosy Hospital in Madhesh Province, and Green Pastures Hospital *Hariyo Kharka Aspatal* (हरियो खर्क अस्पताल) in Pokhara.

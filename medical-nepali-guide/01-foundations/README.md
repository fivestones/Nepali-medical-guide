# 01 Foundations

These files introduce the communication strategy and shared clinical vocabulary that the rest of the guide builds on.

## Files

- [Part 1: Sensitive Language and Clinical Registers](./part-1-sensitive-language-and-registers.md)
- [Section 1: General Illness, Vitals & Trajectories (सामान्य शब्दावली र नाप)](./01-general-illness-vitals-trajectories-सामान्य-शब्दावली-र-नाप.md)
- [Section 2: Life Stages (जीवनका चरणहरु)](./02-life-stages-जीवनका-चरणहरु.md)

## Organization Notes

- Register and sensitive-language guidance comes first because it affects how the rest of the vocabulary should be used.
- General illness, vitals, and symptom trajectories are shared clinical building blocks rather than organ-specific terms.
- Life-stage vocabulary sits here because it supports later chapters on pediatrics, women's health, and end-of-life communication.
